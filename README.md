# PDF Merger

This micro-project is a tool to merge multiple pdf files in a single one.
It is for those who do not have Adobe and do not want to use an online merger (like ILovePDF)
It is more a micro-programme that I want to add to my website than a reel projet

## Installation

To use it, make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
Same for the library PyPDF2 with : 
pip install PyPDF2


## Use it

To use it in local (for now) : 

1. Clone the repo with :

git clone https://github.com/votre_nom_utilisateur/fusionneur_pdf.git

2. get to the directory :

cd fusionneur_pdf

3. Put your files you want to merge in `fichiers_pre_fusion`.
4. Ex√©cutez le script `fusionneur.py` en utilisant la commande suivante :

python3 fusionneur.py -name 'file_name'

The merged file will be saved in the root
